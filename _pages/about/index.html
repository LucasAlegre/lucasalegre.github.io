<p>I am an Adjunct Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/site/en/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Institute of Informatics</a> at the <a href="http://www.ufrgs.br/english/home" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS)</a>. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from this same university, where I was advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~bazzan/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ana Bazzan</a> and Prof. <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~bsilva" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bruno C. da Silva</a>.
Part of my Ph.D. was done in the <a href="https://ai.vub.ac.be/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AI Lab</a> at the <a href="https://www.vub.be/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB)</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://ai.vub.ac.be/team/ann-nowe/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ann Nowé</a>.</p>

<p>I am also part of the <a href="https://farama.org/team" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Farama Foundation</a>, a nonprofit organization that maintains the largest open-source RL libraries in the world.</p>

<p>I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science <i>cum laude</i> at the <a href="http://www.ufrgs.br/english/home" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul</a> in 2020.
My undergraduate thesis, advised by Prof. <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~bsilva" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bruno C. da Silva</a>, tackled the problem of reinforcement learning in continuous non-stationary environments.</p>

<!-- In Winter of 2020, I worked as an intern researcher at the <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/en/">Technische Universität Berlin</a>, under supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/vsp/ueber-uns/fachgebietsleitung">Kai Nagel</a>. -->

<p><i>
My main research interests are in reinforcement learning (RL) and its use to empower artificial intelligence agents to solve real-world problems.

<p><i><mark style="background: rgba(0, 118, 223, 0.1)">In my Ph.D., I tackled the problem of <strong>how to design principled sample-efficient RL algorithms capable of learning multiple behaviors that can be combined to solve multi-task and multi-objective problems.</strong></mark></i></p>
