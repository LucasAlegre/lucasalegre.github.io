I am a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/site/en/">Institute of Informatics</a> at the <a href="http://www.ufrgs.br/english/home">Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS)</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~bazzan/">Ana Bazzan</a>.
Part of my Ph.D. was done in the <a href="https://ai.vub.ac.be/">AI Lab</a> at the <a href="https://www.vub.be/">Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB)</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://ai.vub.ac.be/team/ann-nowe/">Ann Nowé</a>.

I am also part of the <a href="https://farama.org/team">Farama Foundation</a>, a nonprofit organization that maintains the largest open-source RL libraries in the world.

I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science <i>cum laude</i> at the <a href="http://www.ufrgs.br/english/home">Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul</a> in 2020.
My undergraduate thesis, advised by Prof. <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~bsilva">Bruno C. da Silva</a>, tackled the problem of reinforcement learning in continuous non-stationary environments.

<hr>
<i>My research interests include reinforcement learning (RL), machine learning, artificial intelligence, and their applications to real-world problems. 
In my Ph.D., I am tackling the problem of how to design sample-efficient RL algorithms capable of learning multiple behaviors that can be combined to solve any multi-task and multi-objective problems.

<!-- In Winter of 2020, I worked as an intern researcher at the <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/en/">Technische Universität Berlin</a>, under supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.tu-berlin.de/?id=12926">Kai Nagel</a>. -->
