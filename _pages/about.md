<hr>
I am a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/site/en/">Institute of Informatics</a> at the <a href="http://www.ufrgs.br/english/home">Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS)</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~bazzan/">Ana Bazzan</a> and Prof. <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~bsilva">Bruno C. da Silva</a>.
Part of my Ph.D. was done in the <a href="https://ai.vub.ac.be/">AI Lab</a> at the <a href="https://www.vub.be/">Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB)</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://ai.vub.ac.be/team/ann-nowe/">Ann Nowé</a>.

I am also part of the <a href="https://farama.org/team">Farama Foundation</a>, a nonprofit organization that maintains the largest open-source RL libraries in the world.

I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science <i>cum laude</i> at the <a href="http://www.ufrgs.br/english/home">Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul</a> in 2020.
My undergraduate thesis, advised by Prof. <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~bsilva">Bruno C. da Silva</a>, tackled the problem of reinforcement learning in continuous non-stationary environments.

In Winter of 2020, I worked as an intern researcher at the <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/en/">Technische Universität Berlin</a>, under supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/vsp/ueber-uns/fachgebietsleitung">Kai Nagel</a>.

My main research interests are in reinforcement learning (RL) and its use to empower artificial intelligence agents to solve real-world problems.
